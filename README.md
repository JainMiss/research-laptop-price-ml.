Title: Laptop Price Estimation Using Data-Driven Predictive Analytics Authors: Dr. Lokendra Singh, Mitali Gupta,                                   Muskan Jain Journal: International Journal on Science and Technology (IJSAT) Volume: 16, Issue 2, April–June 2025                            

This repository showcases the research project "Laptop Price Estimation Using Data-Driven Predictive Analytics," published in the International Journal on Science and Technology (IJSAT), Vol. 16, Issue 2, Apr–Jun 2025. It presents a machine learning model that predicts laptop prices based on specifications like brand, processor, RAM, storage, and GPU. Using a cleaned dataset of 1,300 entries, models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression were evaluated—Random Forest performed best with R² = 0.90 and MAE = 0.14. The project includes a Streamlit-based web app deployed on Heroku for real-time predictions, aiding both consumers and retailers with data-driven pricing decisions.
